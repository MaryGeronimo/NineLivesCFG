      Here at Nine Lives, we strive to know all there is about cats in the media. Of course we are all familiar with The
      Cat in the Hat, Garfield, Hello Kitty and Grumpy Cat. But what about all the cat game characters out there??
      Rover? King Tom? Palicoes? Meowth? Hopefully you recognise that last name! Cats have often been depicted in games
      as loveable, feisty, sometimes intimidating characters and game developers have cottoned on to just how much the
      public love those crazy furballs. Over the last few years, adventure games have enabled a petting function when
      you see a passing cat. The tamagotchi sadly lost its relevance but cat pet simulator games were born. Game
      developers have now created the ability to <b>play as a cat</b>.

          Since the dawn of cinema, in 1895, cats have famously been depicted
          in live action and animated meowvies. You may be familiar with the
          work of Garfield and TopCat but we endeavour to reveal some hidden
          purrformers to you. Here, you will learn more about ‘the cat in
          Aliens’ and the black cat in Sabrina the Teenage Witch so
          <i>aptly</i> named Salem. We have even delved into the YouTube
          sensation that is Owl Kitty, a creator who uses editing software to
          seamlessly incorporate his cat into classic movie scenes. If you are
          a film buff, you will love our Furry Flix!
