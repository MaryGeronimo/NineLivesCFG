        Here at Nine Lives, we strive to know all there is about cats in the
        media. Of course we are all familiar with The Cat in the Hat, Garfield,
        Hello Kitty and Grumpy Cat. But what about all the cat game characters
        out there?? Rover? King Tom? Palicoes? Meowth? Hopefully you recognise
        that last name! Cats have often been depicted in games as loveable,
        feisty, sometimes intimidating characters and game developers have
        cottoned on to just how much the public love those crazy furballs. Over
        the last few years, adventure games have enabled a petting function when
        you see a passing cat. The tamagotchi sadly lost its relevance but cat
        pet simulator games were born. Game developers have now created the
        ability to <b>play as a cat</b>.

            Our featured cat game this month, and probably for a while, is none
            other than <i>Stray</i>. Released in 2022, <i>Stray</i> is an
            adventure game created by BlueTwelve Studio and Annapurna
            Interactive. The story follows a beautiful ginger stray cat (who is
            never named) who falls into a walled city populated by robotic
            beings and dangerous mutant bacteria. Playing as the cat, in 3rd
            person, you will set out on an adventure to return to the safety of
            the surface world. Along the way, you discover a drone who quickly
            becomes a helpful companion and friend, B-12. Whilst on your Cat
            Quest through the robot-inhabited world, you will mantle walls,
            crawl in small spaces, scratch at furniture and knock small items
            off shelves - if you feel like it! It is such an enjoyable
            experience and it is beautifully made.

            The cat in <i>Stray</i> was initially inspired by the BlueTwelve
            co-founders' cat Murtaugh (pictured above). Murtaugh was a stray cat
            who was rescued by the producer Swann Martin-Raget and later adopted
            by the co-founders Viv and Koola. Murtaugh was discovered under a
            car when he was a kitten and was very filthy but fortunately
            unharmed. The producer took Murtaugh in and gave him a loving home,
            where he apparently spends most of the time sleeping. The studio
            also has two office cats that the employees would often bring in,
            offering developers the chance to get a quick point of reference for
            cat behaviours.

            Another group of game cats worth mentioning are the ones found in
            the <i>Animal Crossing</i> series. The series first began in 2001 in
            Japan and has had 4 more game releases since. There are 30 different
            cat characters in the series and players can invite them to become
            residents on their very own island. From Ankha to Felicity to Bob,
            they all have their own quirks and personality traits. It's
            definitely worth a play if you think you would enjoy a cozy game
            where you can befriend cats (and a variety of other animals).
