      Purrformers since birth, cats are inherent actors! Here, we will discuss some of their
      best purrformances. The very first cat to be shown on screen was the star of the 1901
      silent short comedic film <i>The Sick Kitten</i>, which was only 34 seconds long. Ever since, they have been a
      cinema staple! Sometimes they're cute, and sometimes they're creepy, but a film is almost
      always more interesting with a feline friend. From Church the cat in <i>Pet Sematary</i> to the Hanna Barbera
      cartoon cat Tom in <i>Tom and Jerry</i>, we love them all. Check out our <a class="link"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/@NineLives.Trivia" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel, where we discuss our
      favourite cat
      characters. Let us know if you think we've missed someone!

        Since the dawn of cinema, in 1895, cats have famously been depicted in
        live action and animated meowvies. You may be familiar with the work of
        Garfield and TopCat but we endeavour to reveal some hidden purrformers
        to you. Here, you will learn more about ‘the cat in Aliens’ and the
        black cat in Sabrina the Teenage Witch so <i>aptly</i> named Salem. We
        have even delved into the YouTube sensation that is Owl Kitty, a creator
        who uses editing software to seamlessly incorporate his cat into classic
        movie scenes. If you are a film buff, you will love our Furry Flix!
